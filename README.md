# better_shell
A unix shell that trumps all others.

LIST OF SHIT TO DO:

- Add some sort of command that touches the kernel
- Add some more commands 
- Tweak existing code so it works the same or better and is somewhat original

- Stuff we can add:
  - Show working directory in command line
  - Possible make a new UI?.. would be cool rather than just the existing terminal
  - add "history" command: shows past inputs (we can do like past 10)
  - add "clear" command
